  have been given)
- `bot merge cancel` to cancel a pending `bot merge`

### FAQ
- Who are `core-devs`? 
	- https://github.com/orgs/paritytech/teams/core-devs/members

- Who are `substrateteamleads`?

- What is a project column and how do I attach one?
	- A project column is necessary for Processbot to identify a project owner.
	- Approval from a relevant project owner removes the need for further approvals.
	- A pull request can be attached to a project column using the Github web UI (similar to attaching a label):

		- No project *(cannot be recognised)*

		![](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-processbot/blob/master/no-project.png)
	
		- A project but no column *(cannot be recognised)*
	
		![](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-processbot/blob/master/no-column.png)
	
		- The project `parity-processbot` and column `general` *(will be recognised)*
