### FAQ
- Who are `core-devs`? 
	- https://github.com/orgs/paritytech/teams/core-devs/members

- Who are `substrateteamleads`?
	- https://github.com/orgs/paritytech/teams/substrateteamleads/members

- What is a project column and how do I attach one?
	- A project column is necessary for Processbot to identify a project owner.
	- Approval from a relevant project owner removes the need for further approvals.
	- A pull request can be attached to a project column using the Github web UI (similar to attaching a label):

		- No project *(cannot be recognised)*

		![](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-processbot/blob/master/no-project.png)
	
		- A project but no column *(cannot be recognised)*
	
		![](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-processbot/blob/master/no-column.png)
	
		- The project `parity-processbot` and column `general` *(will be recognised)*

## CI/CD

 - Deployment via gitlab is done by tagging any commit with `/^pre-v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+.*$/` for staging or `/^v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+.*$/` for production. The latter should only be done on `master`, but that is currently not enforced.
 - The environment variables for both staging and production live in the helm `kubernetes/processbot/values*.yml` files. If you add one, it also needs to be added in `templates/processbot.yaml`.
 - If any secrets need to be changed, contact the devops team.

## Staging Environment

The staging environment is deployed in the Kubernetes cluster `parity-stg` (GCP project
`parity-stg`). There is a separate Github App for it and
[a (private) repository that contains the Polkadot code](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-for-processbot-staging),
which has this app installed. This repo is connected to [a (private) project on Gitlab](https://gitlab.parity.io/parity/polkadot-for-processbot-staging).
